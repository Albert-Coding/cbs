Cluster Boot Service (CBS)
==========================

A web service that solves first-boot, start-dependency and node allocation through dynamic script
creation for Hydra compute clusters.

Getting Started
===============

 - place your executable jar in ``config/image/default/lib/hydra.jar``
 - place a zip of the hydra web dir in ``config/image/default/web.zip``
 - ``node start boothost=[HYDRA_BOOT]``
 - ``[HYDRA_BOOT]`` is the ``host:port`` of the CBS host as seen from booting nodes
 - create account  ``(http://[HYDRA_BOOT]/api/create_account)``
 - create cluster  ``(http://[HYDRA_BOOT]/api/create_cluster?account=[ACCOUNT_ID])``

Boot Cluster Node
=================

 - ``bash <(curl -s "http://[HYDRA_BOOT]/boot?cluster=[CLUSTER_ID]")``
 - to boot a localstack, use ``localstack`` as your [CLUSTER_ID]
